Navigating Pillars of Faith: Book of Zakat

- often paired with praying salah in the quran
- not actually limited only to ramadan
- should try to engage in on a daily basis

what is zakat about?
- community coming together and supporting each other
- economically suporting each other (spiritual development = salah)
- zakat is more of a communal thing compared to salah
- removes barriers to your spiritual growth (greed especially)
- zakat is like a financial net to catch those that fall off the economic ladder

- random ruling: can pay zakat in advance (?)

MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR TRADE-BASED ECONOMY

*note that both gold and silver were of similar spending power during the time of the prophet pbuh*
(june 4, 2024)
Gold = 20 dinars (87.48g) = $8005.81
Silver = 200 dirhams (612.35g) = $637.58

Money + Gold/Silver + Trade Goods - Debts&Liabilities >= Nisab
- money = all forms of fiat currency (anything in your bank account, tfsa, rresp, loans you will get back)
- must pay 2.5%

Zakat Anniversary
- happens every lunar year
- the legal requirement is for an individual to possess the nsab at both the beginning and end of the lunar year,
  - irrespective of what occurs in-between
  - if your net worth goes to zero or below, your anniversary resets
    - Ramadan 1 = first nisab (anniversary)
    - Dhu'l Qu'dah 1 = bankrupt
    - Dhu'l Qu'dah 27 = nisab again (new anniversary)
