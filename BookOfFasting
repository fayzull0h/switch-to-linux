BOOK OF FASTING
Fasting is not just about refraining from food and drink:
- there should be great emphasis on the spiritual aspect as well
- for example, it helps you gain taqwa

to actually or legally abstain
from the invalidators
from dawn until sunset,
with its intention,
from somebody who is required to fast

1. Abstain
- actually
  - literally avoiding invalidators
- legally
  - invalidated, but excused to due forgetfulness
  - not conscious of the fact that you're fasting
(main difference between forgetfulness and an accident is that in an accident, one is conscious that theyre fasting)

tasting food: only if husband is oppressive and theres fear that if the food is bad, she will be harmed

2. Intention
- night (intention made between maghrib and fajr)
  - for makeup fasts and expiatory fasts

- day (intention made between maghrib and islamic midday (when sun is at zenith))
  - for ramadan and sunnah fasts such as ashurah, arafah

if the fast has been specified, the Lawgiver seeks that you minimally make an intention "most" of the day
-- that point ends at Islamic midday.

3. somebody who is required to fast
conditions:
- general obligations (morally obligated, rewarded if done, punished if left)
  - being muslim, sanity, adulthood
- specific conditions for validity (might be excused due to extunuating circumstances) 
  - having an intention, residency, being free from menstruation and lochia

Types of fast:
fardh: ramadan, expiation, vowed fasts
wajib: voluntary fast that was broken
sunnah: 10th muharram and 9th
mandub: 3 days a month (13/14/15), mondays & thursdays, 6 days in shawwal
makruh: days of eid and tashreeq, (ONLY) fridays/saturdays, fasting back to back

*sighting the moon is the legal cause for fasting (for ramadan)

hadith in muslim:

observe the fast on sighting the new moon of ramadan and break the fast on sighting the new moon of shawwal.
but if the sky is cloudy for you, then calculate it (the month of shaban) as thirty days

the moon has phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous,
                     last quarter, waning crescent

cannot see new moon because the moon will be directly between earth and sun during this phase

so we are sighting the waxing crescent with the naked eye
which generally starts to be seen 12 hours after the "new moon" phase
  - could be up to 18 hours before you see it

astronomical sciences can be used to validate/invalidate moon sighting claimings
(i guess it shouldnt be used to establish the sighting in the first place)
Moon Sighting is established based on reports

Reports:
- worldly affairs
  - requires a form of testimony (shahada)
  - for example, affirming that a debt is due at the beginning of a particular month
- religious affairs
  - acceptable if provided by an upright individual
  - for example, claiming that dhuhr time has set in
  - or ramadan has begun
  - or the place youre using for prayer is filthy

Establishing the entry month of ramadan
- clear sky
  - a large group of people can establish it
  - one, two, or a small number of people sighting here is unacceptable because if it was clear sky, more shouldve seen it
- obstructed sky
  - report of one upright individual establishes it
  - must be accepted by the chief judge or the authoritative moon sighting committee
  - however, if the authority invalidates your sighting, the individual will still be required to fast

Establishing the exit of ramadan:
- clear sky
  - a large group of people must see the moon
- obstructed sky
  - the testimony of two, free, upright males, or one male + two females (verse 282 baqara)
  - because this is a worldly affair report since ramadan is the most sacred month

Sighting of the crescent makes the fast mandatory upon every muslim, locally and abroad
- this is the dominant opinion within the hanafi school

Moonsighting:
- local
  - every region will independently seek to sight the moon
  - other regions sighting the moon is not taken into consideration, regardless of proximity
  - the view adopted by most muslim countries: saudi, india, pakistan, south africa
  - issue: locality definitions
- global
  - the sighting of the moon in any region will suffice for the entire world
  - view is adopted by many muslim communities in non-muslim countries: canada, usa, uk, etc
  - issue: 28 day ramadan

advice of mufti hammad: follow your local masjid, the place where you will pray eid, etc
people say unity, but unity is not a legal cause

Mufsidaat wa Kaffaaraat:
Any discernible substance which enters the body cavity through a recognized orifice and proceeds into the digestive tract,
invalidates the fast (unless there is an excuse)

- discernible substance: smth that has a perceptible body (solid, liquid or gas)
- the opening through which it enters must be considered a valid opening by the sharia (mouth, anus, nose)

An expiation is due when a person (1) deliberately invalidates a fast of ramadan 
by fulfilling the desire of the stomach or private organ fully
and (2) there is no legally absolving excuse or doubt

expiation = freeing an enslaved muslim, or fasting 2 consecutive lunar months, or feeding 60 zakat-eligible people

Breaking Fast:
forgetfully: no expiation, no make up (qadha)
accidentally: make up (qadha), no expiation
deliberately: expiation and make up

Eating:
Food: banana/cereal/milk (things considered to be food) -> must do kaffaara and qadha
(food in terms of form and meaning)
Non-food: paper/soil/poison -> must do qadha only
(non-food, edible in its form but not considered food conventionally)
(however, it is considered food if it is desirable)

Intercourse:
actual: kaffaara
(male genitalia -> female genitalia)
legally: qadha only
(ejaculation with a physical stimulant, if there is no stimulation then the fast does not break, wet dream doesnt break)

Vomiting:
if it is a mouthful
induced: qadha only
spontaneous: fast does not break
(without swallowing deliberately)

Concession:
can take concession:
- fasting as a traveler
- fasting when sick
must take concession:
- shortening prayers as a traveler

Sickness:
actual: fasting will worsen sickness
- pregnant and nursing ladies should fast as a principle
  - can make qadha for it later
legally: fasting will delay recovery

1. established by an upright, muslim doctor
2. if youve had relevant experience like this before
3. there must be clear and obvious signs

Fidya:
when unable to fast altogether, expiatory payments are due for each day of fasting
3.64kg = 1 Sa'
1.82kg = 0.5 Sa'

1.82kg of rice/dates must be given to zakat-eligible people

Travelling:
Travelers must be outside the city limits at the time of true dawn and until sunset for the concession to apply

During Ramadan, if the condition for your concession is no longer there, they must imitate fasting people

Itikaaf:
- to remain in a mosque with an intention

- mandatory when you make a vow
  - the retreat is minimally one day and one night in length (24 hours)
  - must be done in the state of fasting

- sunnah to do i'tikaaf in Ramadhan

- recommended to do it at any other time
  - no minimum

Masjid:
- actual
  - a place where the 5 daily prayers take place
  - some say jumua must also take place in that masjid
- effective
  - the home prayer space can become a masjid
    - only for women though
    - women are not allowed to do i'tikaaf in actual masjid

Needs that allow you to leave the 4 walls of the prayer hall:
- natural needs
  - such as going to the bathroom
- religious
  - attending salaat al-jama'ah (like friday prayer)
- exceptional needs
  - forced to leave in danger
  - prophet pbuh walked his wife home once and then continued his i'tikaaf
